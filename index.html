            <p>After her father, step-mother, step-sister and little brother are killed by her father's employers, the
                12-year-old daughter of an abject drug dealer manages to take refuge in the apartment of a professional
                hitman who at her request teaches her the methods of his job so she can take her revenge on the corrupt
                DEA agent who ruined her life by killing her beloved brother.</p>

                <p>The plants are symbolic for the kind of life that Leon was living. Regardless of where he lived, what kind of danger he was in, he must water the plants, and must carry them around.</p>

            <h2>Trivia</h2>
            <p>According to Jean Reno, he decided to play Léon as if he were "a little mentally slow" and emotionally repressed. He felt that this would make audiences relax and realize that he wasn't someone who would take advantage of a vulnerable young girl. Reno claims that for Léon, the possibility of a physical relationship with Mathilda is not even conceivable, and as such, during the scenes when such a relationship is discussed, Reno very much allowed Portman to be emotionally in control of the scenes.</p>
